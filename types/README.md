# xrm-cli/types

Libraries of types documented at [Client API Reference for Model-Driven Apps | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/reference).

This library:

-  Provides basic suppport for Dynamics web resources written in TypeScript
-  Provides base types for generated type artifacts to inherit from

Hopefully in the future, this library can provide more types and support more languages, primarily C# since that's what many other Dynamics customizations are written in.
